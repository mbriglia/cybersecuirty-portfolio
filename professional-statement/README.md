# Professional Statement
I am a cybersecurity student with a strong intrtest in protecting systems, data, and users through practical security fundamentals and analytical problem-solving. I am currently building my technical foundation through academic coursework and the Google Cybersecurity Certificate, with hands-on experience in Linux, SQL, security audits, and incident response documentation.
I am especially interested in understanding how security incidents occur, how vulnerablilities are identified, and how organizations can reduce risk through proper controls and monitoring. Through labs and projects, I have practiced analyzing logs, applying SQL queries to investigate data, managing file permissions in Linux, and documenting incedents using structured response methodlogies.
What draws me to cybersecurity is the balance between technical skills and critical thinking. I enjoy breaking down complex problems, paying attention to detail, and clearly documenting findings so they can be understood by both technical and non-technical audiences. I value accuracy, organization, and continuous learning, especially in a field that evolves as quickly as cybersecurity.
I am seeking internships or entry-level opportunities where I can continue developing my skills, gain real-world experience, and contribute to a team focused on maintaining secure and reliable systems.
